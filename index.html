                <p>
                    The Russell House is facing a crisis right now. Between low labor participation and students believing that the Russell House is the only place on campus they are able to eat. This is creating astronomical wait times for food in the Russell House. Solving this problem is
                    urgent to allow a more enjoyable dining experience for students and workers.
